# An R Docker image for running Shiny maps

This Docker image will pre-build the packages necessary for running an R Shiny map in Heroku, since compiling R and all the required packages can easily take 20min. To use this image, just reference in your Dockerfile like so:

```Dockerfile
FROM tomcardoso/docker-r-shiny-map

# Other stuff goes hereâ€¦
```
